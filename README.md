- ðŸ˜ƒ Hi, My name is KAROL

-  I am interested ðŸ‘€ in coding, 3D design and 3D printing, prototyping. I recently completed a post-graduate ðŸ’» Front-End developer with HTML CSS JavaScript with Angular at Merito WSB Wroclaw, after which I continue to gain front-end knowledge and build my portfolio with projects from a wide range of front-end.
  
- My plans for future is to get more experience as fullstack and dive deeper into Angular world.
